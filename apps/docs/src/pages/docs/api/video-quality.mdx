# Quality Track

This section covers the functions related to video quality tracks in the `VideoPlayer` class.

## Methods

### getQualityTracks()

Retrieves the available video quality levels.

- **Returns:** `Array` - An array of quality level objects containing the following properties:
  - `id: string`: Unique identifier for the quality level.
  - `height: number`: Height of the video in pixels.
  - `width: number`: Width of the video in pixels.
  - `bitrate: number`: Bitrate of the video stream.
  - `frameRate: number`: Frame rate of the video.
  - `enabled: boolean`: Indicates if this quality level is currently enabled.

**Example:**

```javascript
const qualityLevels = player.getQualityTracks();
console.log("Available Quality Levels:", qualityLevels);

Available Quality Levels:
[
    {
        "id": "0-placeholder-uri-0",
        "height": 360,
        "width": 640,
        "bitrate": 300000,
        "frameRate": 30,
        "enabled": true
    }
]
```

### setQualityTrack(id)

Sets the video quality level based on the specified ID.

- **Parameters:**
  - `id: string`: The ID of the desired quality level to enable. This should match one of the IDs from the `getQualityTracks()` output.

**Example:**

```javascript
player.setQualityTrack("0-placeholder-uri-0");
```

## Usage

To manipulate video quality tracks, you can use these functions to get available quality options and set your preferred quality. Here's a brief example:

```javascript
import { videoPlayer, VideoPlayerInstance } from '@dust/player';

const playerInstance: VideoPlayerInstance = videoPlayer;
playerInstance.init(document.getElementById('videoElement'), {
  controls: true,
  autoplay: false,
}, () => {
  console.log('Player is ready');

  // Get and log available quality levels
  const qualityLevels = playerInstance.getQualityTracks();
  console.log('Available Quality Levels:', qualityLevels);

  // Set a specific quality level by ID
  playerInstance.setQualityTrack("0-placeholder-uri-0");
});
```

In this example, the player is initialized, the available quality levels are retrieved and logged, and a specific quality level is set based on the available options.
