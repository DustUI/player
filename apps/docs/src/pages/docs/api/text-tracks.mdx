```

### toggleCaptions()

## Usage

To manipulate text tracks such as subtitles or captions, you can use these functions to retrieve available tracks, enable or disable them, and toggle their visibility. Here's a brief example:

```javascript
import { videoPlayer, VideoPlayerInstance } from './VideoPlayer';

const playerInstance: VideoPlayerInstance = videoPlayer;
playerInstance.init(document.getElementById('videoElement'), {
  controls: true,
  autoplay: false,
}, () => {
  console.log('Player is ready');

  // Get and log available text tracks
  const textTracks = playerInstance.getTextTrack();
  console.log('Available Text Tracks:', textTracks);

  // Enable a specific text track by index
  playerInstance.changeTextTrack(0); // Adjust index to match available tracks

  // Toggle captions
  playerInstance.toggleCaptions();
});
```

In this example, the player is initialized, the available text tracks are retrieved and logged, a specific text track is enabled based on the available options, and captions are toggled.
