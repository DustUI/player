# Audio Track

This section covers the functions related to audio tracks in the `VideoPlayer` class.

## Methods

### getAudioTracks()

Retrieves the available audio tracks.

- **Returns:** `Array` - An array of audio track objects containing the following properties:
  - `id: string`: Unique identifier for the audio track.
  - `label: string`: Label describing the audio track.
  - `language: string`: Language code of the audio track.
  - `enabled: boolean`: Indicates if this audio track is currently enabled.

**Example:**

```javascript
const audioTracks = player.getAudioTracks();
console.log("Available Audio Tracks:", audioTracks);

Available Audio Tracks:
[
    {
        "index": 0,
        "id": "en (main)",
        "label": "en (main)",
        "language": "en",
        "enabled": true,
        "kind": "main"
    }
]
```

### setAudioTrack(index)

Enables a specific audio track by its index.

- **Parameters:**
  - `index: number`: The index of the audio track to enable. This should be within the range of the available audio tracks from the `getAudioTracks()` output.

**Example:**

```javascript
player.setAudioTrack(0); // Enables the first audio track
```

## Usage

To manipulate audio tracks, you can use these functions to get available audio options and set your preferred track. Here's a brief example:

```javascript
import { videoPlayer, VideoPlayerInstance } from './VideoPlayer';

const playerInstance: VideoPlayerInstance = videoPlayer;
playerInstance.init(document.getElementById('videoElement'), {
  controls: true,
  autoplay: false,
}, () => {
  console.log('Player is ready');

  // Get and log available audio tracks
  const audioTracks = playerInstance.getAudioTracks();
  console.log('Available Audio Tracks:', audioTracks);

  // Set a specific audio track by index
  playerInstance.setAudioTrack(1); // Adjust index to match available tracks
});
```

In this example, the player is initialized, the available audio tracks are retrieved and logged, and a specific audio track is set based on the available options.
