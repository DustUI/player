## Example

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { useAudioTrack } from "@dust/player";

const AudioTrackSelector = () => {
  const { isAvailable, tracks, changeAudioTrack } = useAudioTrack();

  return (
    <div>
      {isAvailable ? (
        <ul>
          {tracks.map((track) => (
            <li key={track.id}>
              <button onClick={() => changeAudioTrack(track.index)}>
                {track.label} ({track.language})
              </button>
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      ) : (
        <p>No audio tracks available</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default AudioTrackSelector;
```

In this example, the `AudioTrackSelector` component uses the `useAudioTrack` hook to list available audio tracks and allows users to switch between them.
