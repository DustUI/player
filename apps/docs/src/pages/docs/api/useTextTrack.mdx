## Example

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { useTextTrack } from "@dust/player";

const TextTrackSelector = () => {
  const { isAvailable, tracks, disableTextTrack, enableTextTrack, isDisable } =
    useTextTrack();

  return (
    <div>
      {isAvailable ? (
        <div>
          <button onClick={disableTextTrack}>Disable Tracks</button>
          <ul>
            {tracks.map((track) => (
              <li key={track.id}>
                <button onClick={() => enableTextTrack(track.index)}>
                  {track.label} ({track.language})
                </button>
              </li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <p>No text tracks available</p>
      )}
      {isDisable && <p>Tracks are disabled</p>}
    </div>
  );
};

export default TextTrackSelector;
```

In this example, the `TextTrackSelector` component uses the `useTextTrack` hook to list available text tracks, allowing users to switch between them or disable them entirely.
