## Example

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { useQualityTrack } from "@dust/player";

const QualitySelector = () => {
  const {
    tracks,
    selectedQuality,
    isAuto,
    changeQualityTrack,
    setAutoQuality,
  } = useQualityTrack();

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Quality Levels</h3>
      <button onClick={setAutoQuality} disabled={isAuto}>
        Auto
      </button>
      <ul>
        {tracks.map((track) => (
          <li key={track.id}>
            <button
              onClick={() => changeQualityTrack(track.id)}
              disabled={selectedQuality === track.id}>
              {track.label} ({track.height}p)
            </button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default QualitySelector;
```

In this example, the `QualitySelector` component uses the `useQualityTrack` hook to list available quality levels, allowing users to switch between them or set the quality to automatic.
