To create documentation for the `TogglePlay` component, which serves as a play/pause button integrated with a video player using Video.js, follow this structured approach:

### TogglePlay Play/Pause

The `TogglePlay` component is a React component that provides a play/pause button functionality integrated with Video.js for video playback control.

#### Props

import Link from "next/link";

The component accepts props from the `Button` component. <span className="text-red-200"><Link href="/docs/components/button">Click here</Link></span> to read more.

#### Example Usage

```jsx
import { TogglePlay, MediaPlayer } from "@dust/player";

function InitializePlayer() {
    return <MediaPlayer
        options={{
            autoplay: false,
            controls: true,
            responsive: true,
            aspectRatio: '16:9',

            sources: [
            {
                src: "https://d2zihajmogu5jn.cloudfront.net/elephantsdream/hls/ed_hd.m3u8",
            },
            ],

        }}
        className="w-full"
    />
}

function VideoPlayerControls() {
  return (
    <div className="video-controls">
      <TogglePlay color="purple" size="md" icon />
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <InitializePlayer/>
    <VideoPlayerControls />
  );
}

```

import { TogglePlay, MediaPlayer } from "@dust/player";

<MediaPlayer
    options={{
        autoplay: false,
        controls: true,
        responsive: true,
        aspectRatio: '16:9',
        muted: true,
        sources: [
        {
            src: "https://d2zihajmogu5jn.cloudfront.net/elephantsdream/hls/ed_hd.m3u8",
        },
        ],

    }}
    className="hidden"

/>

<TogglePlay color="purple" size="md" icon />

### Functionality

- **Play/Pause Toggle**: Clicking the button toggles between play and pause states of the video player.
- **Video Player Integration**: Monitors the video player's `timeupdate` event to reflect the current play state (`isPlaying`).

### Integration Notes

- Ensure that `videoPlayer` is correctly initialized and accessible within the scope where `TogglePlay` is used.
- Use this `<MediaPlayer>` component to initialized the video player
- Customize the appearance and behavior of the button using props such as `color`, `size`, and `icon`.
