### ToggleFullscreen

The `ToggleFullscreen` component is a React component that provides fullscreen toggle button functionality integrated with Video.js for video player control.

#### Props

The component accepts props from the `Button` component. [Click here](/docs/components/button) to read more.

#### Example Usage

```jsx
import { ToggleFullscreen, MediaPlayer } from "@dust/player";

function InitializePlayer() {
  return (
    <MediaPlayer
      options={{
        autoplay: false,
        controls: true,
        responsive: true,
        aspectRatio: "16:9",
        sources: [
          {
            src: "https://d2zihajmogu5jn.cloudfront.net/elephantsdream/hls/ed_hd.m3u8",
          },
        ],
      }}
      className="w-full"
    />
  );
}

function VideoPlayerControls() {
  return (
    <div className="video-controls">
      <ToggleFullscreen color="purple" size="md" icon />
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <InitializePlayer />
      <VideoPlayerControls />
    </>
  );
}
```

import { ToggleFullscreen, MediaPlayer } from "@dust/player";

<MediaPlayer
  options={{
    autoplay: false,
    controls: true,
    responsive: true,
    aspectRatio: "16:9",
    muted: true,
    sources: [
      {
        src: "https://d2zihajmogu5jn.cloudfront.net/elephantsdream/hls/ed_hd.m3u8",
      },
    ],
  }}
  className="hidden"
/>

<ToggleFullscreen color="purple" size="md" icon />

### Functionality

- **Fullscreen Toggle**: Clicking the button toggles between fullscreen and normal screen modes of the video player.
- **Video Player Integration**: Monitors the video player's `fullscreenchange` event to reflect the current fullscreen state (`isFullscreen`).

### Integration Notes

- Ensure that `videoPlayer` is correctly initialized and accessible within the scope where `ToggleFullscreen` is used.
- Customize the appearance and behavior of the button using props such as `color`, `size`, and `icon`.
